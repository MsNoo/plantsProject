            <h4>What are invasive plants?</h4>
            <div class="authorFeatures">&#169 By David Beaulieu</div>
            <p> By simple definition, invasive plants are non-native species that show a
                tendency to spread out of
                control.
                The label "invasive" is generally reserved for plants that have been introduced from other regions and
                spread like wildfire in their new habitats. This definition distinguishes invasive plants from other
                plants that more accurately are called "aggressive." The introduction of invasive species can cause
                economic or environmental harm, or can even harm human health. They compete with native plants for
                water,
                light, nutrients, and space. They compete with native plants for water, light, nutrients, and space.
                Invasive
                species contribute to the decline of 42% of the U.S. endangered and threatened species. They degrade
                wildlife
                habitats and water quality, increase soil erosion.

            <h4> What Makes a Non-Native Plant Invasive?</h4>
            <div class="authorFeatures">&#169 By Pennsylvania Department of Conservation & Natural Resources</div>
            <p> While the species may differ, invasive plants have some things in common that
                make them aggressive and
                difficult to control:
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 20px;">
                <li>Ability to grow in many conditions</li>
                <li>Rapid growth</li>
                <li>Ability to exploit and colonize disturbed ground</li>
                <li>Having roots with large food reserves</li>
                <li>Reproduce rapidly by roots and shoots. If spread by seed, produce numerous seeds that disperse and
                    sprout easily</li>
                <li>Lack of natural predators, pathogens, and parasites</li>
                <li> Ability to survive and reproduce under adverse conditions</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Problem With Invasive Plants</h4>
            <div class="authorFeatures">&#169 By Environmental Services (The City of Portland)</div>
            <h6><b>Whater Quality</b></h6>
            <p> When invasive plants like ivy or clematis dominate the groundcover, there is
                very little root structure
                to bind
                the soils. That's why large areas dominated by invasive plants are more likely to erode during flood
                events
                than areas with a diverse understory of trees and shrubs, which provide more root structure diversity.
            </p>
            <p> Native plant roots extend deep into the soil, and many species have wide, branching fibrous root
                structures
                that bind the soils and reduce erosion. Erosion releases sediment to streams, increases stream
                turbidity, and
                impairs water quality. Invasive plants provide less streamside cover and shade, which increases stream
                temperatures.
